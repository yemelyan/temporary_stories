Warsaw's city government created the Spółdzielnia (Cooperative) platform as a free digital marketplace where residents, NGOs and informal groups can share spaces, equipment and skills. Managed by a small municipal team with support from cultural institutions and neighbourhood centres, the platform offers items such as tents, tables, projectors and meeting rooms to facilitate cultural, social and educational activities.

The initiative responds to underused municipal resources and low civic engagement by making it easy to borrow equipment and spaces instead of purchasing them. Users register online, browse available assets and book them for events like workshops, picnics or community meetings; the city coordinates logistics and maintenance, working with libraries, community centres and NGOs.

Since its launch the platform has nurtured a culture of sharing, strengthened trust among citizens and reduced waste by reusing goods. It demonstrates how a basic digital tool can activate idle resources and empower community initiatives; cities aiming to support temporary activities without large budgets can replicate the model, though success depends on institutional backing and efforts to build trust and digital literacy.
