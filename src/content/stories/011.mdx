To make productive use of vacant lots awaiting construction, Las Palmas launched a programme of temporary urban gardens. The Technical Unit for the Environment issues public calls inviting residents to apply for plots; successful applicants receive legal contracts, tools and training from a contracted company and pay a small fee to offset maintenance costs.

The gardens address a lack of green space, promote environmental education and foster social interaction among diverse residents. By defining rights, responsibilities and a competitive allocation process, the city ensures transparency and balances demand for land with the temporary nature of the sites; plots revert to the municipality when development proceeds.

The initiative has improved quality of life, provided fresh produce and increased awareness of urban agriculture. Its structured legal framework and community engagement make it transferable: municipalities can adapt the model by securing temporary land use rights, organising transparent selection procedures and communicating clearly about the eventual return of plots to their owners.
