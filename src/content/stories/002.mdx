The Užupis Art Incubator started when students from the Vilnius Art Academy began squatting abandoned buildings in the dilapidated Užupis district after the Soviet regime collapsed. The most famous squat at Užupio Street 2 evolved into a permanent art incubator after the municipality granted the space for uncompensated use and later provided annual funding – €43,700 in 2017 – to support cultural activities.

The initiative addressed crime and decay in Užupis by transforming a vacant building into a collaborative hub for artists and creatives. A public organisation called the Alternative Art Center and its Galera gallery played a key role, alongside the informal Republic of Užupis established in 1997, which crafted its own flag and constitution and helped mobilise residents. Vilnius City Municipality continues to maintain public infrastructure and renovate the incubator, while artists, residents and tourists animate the space through exhibitions, studios and community events.

The incubator turned Užupis into one of Vilnius's main tourist attractions; in 2018 a dedicated "Užupis – Independent Republic in Vilnius" route was created and the brand now attracts international media attention. Co‑marketing between the municipality and the Republic's ambassadors promotes the district worldwide, showing how squatting can evolve into a celebrated cultural quarter. The model illustrates that municipalities can work with counter‑cultural communities to legalise temporary occupations, provide modest financial support and co‑promote creative districts, making it transferable to cities with vacant heritage buildings and active artistic scenes.
