In 2020 Riga residents turned the derelict Soviet‑era Sports Palace into an urban oasis by creating 'Sporta pils dārzi', a temporary community garden. Over 150 volunteers cleared the asphalt, built raised beds and established 150 garden plots equipped with accessible paths, wheelchair‑friendly toilets and child‑friendly spaces. Plots could be rented for a symbolic fee and the site hosted concerts, film nights and cultural events.

The initiative addressed the lack of green public space and community venues in central Riga and demonstrated how temporary agreements can unlock privately owned land for public benefit. An association coordinated participation, while partners like waste company Clean‑R and landscape firm ALPS provided materials; the municipality supported flexible permits and mediation between the landowner and gardeners.

Over its three‑year lifespan the garden fostered healthy lifestyles, intergenerational cooperation and environmental awareness. Its success shows that, with modest funding and supportive regulations, citizens can transform vacant lots into inclusive communal spaces; other cities can replicate the model by negotiating temporary contracts, ensuring accessibility and involving volunteers and sponsors.
