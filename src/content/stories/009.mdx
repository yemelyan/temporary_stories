In 2015 the municipality of Slatina adopted a Local Council Decision that established procedural requirements and standard contracts for temporary use of public spaces. The regulation sets out terms for street fairs, cultural festivals, seasonal markets and other temporary activities, detailing application procedures, rental costs, taxes, obligations and liabilities for organisers.

Prior to the decision, vendors and event organisers faced uncertainty and bureaucratic barriers when seeking to use squares or streets. The new framework simplifies the process by providing a standardised contract and guidance through municipal departments; it encourages local artisans, entrepreneurs and NGOs to activate underused spaces for events, exhibitions and pop‑up markets.

The regulation has reactivated public spaces, generated revenue for urban regeneration and improved the quality and safety of temporary events. Because the provisions can be easily adapted to other municipalities, the practice shows how clear legal rules and transparent fees can spur meanwhile uses while ensuring municipal oversight and cost recovery.
