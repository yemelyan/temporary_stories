The small Tuscan municipality of Borgo San Lorenzo introduced a pioneering regulation on temporary use as part of its 2021 Operational Plan. Decision No. 35/2021, developed after participatory processes such as Borgo Prossima and Spazi ai Giovani, lays out criteria for identifying disused assets, organising public calls and drafting standardised contracts with 4 + 4‑year terms and flexible rents determined by the quality of proposals.

The policy aims to revitalise vacant municipal buildings and sports fields, address the lack of community and cultural spaces and reconnect hamlets with the town centre. A pilot project in the village of Polcanto invites youth associations and cooperatives to reuse an abandoned sports field, while the municipality provides technical support and ensures transparent evaluation of proposals.

By institutionalising temporary use, Borgo San Lorenzo offers a replicable framework for rural towns dealing with depopulation and vacant heritage. Its clear procedures, public tenders and adaptable contracts encourage community initiatives while protecting public assets; other small municipalities can adapt the guidelines to bring life back to underused spaces.
