France's national Taxe Foncière sur les Propriétés Bâties exemption allows social housing providers operating in priority neighbourhoods to deduct 30 % of property tax on buildings if they sign agreements committing to reinvest the same amount into improving services and the living environment. In Lille Metropole the measure is coordinated by the region and municipalities with three‑year action plans.

The fiscal tool tackles higher management costs and deteriorated public spaces in disadvantaged areas by conditioning tax relief on investments in community amenities, maintenance, energy efficiency and temporary community activities. Stakeholders include the Métropole Européenne de Lille (MEL), state agencies, municipalities, social housing companies and residents who co‑define neighbourhood priorities.

Since its introduction the scheme has financed numerous projects that have improved playgrounds, courtyards and shared rooms, supported meanwhile uses and strengthened social cohesion in priority districts. Because the exemption is national but managed locally through contractual agreements, it can be replicated in other regions seeking to align fiscal incentives with social impact and temporary use of common spaces.
